# rust-grabcut

This is an attempt at an implementation of [grabcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrabCut) in Rust based on the C++ version from [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/grabcut.cpp).

Rust-grabcut uses the [image](https://crates.io/crates/image) crate for basic image related processing.
